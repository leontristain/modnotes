## Credits

The current state of the base mod makes use of 3 Modder's Resources available on the Nexus:

* [Manor House Modders Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61730) by Tlaffoon
* [Castle Modders Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61709) by Tlaffoon
* [Stormcloak Cabin Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66514) by Kraeten

Modifications were made to the original releases of above resources in order to retexture their nifs with Windhelm brick textures. For the Stormcloak Cabin Resource, I further modified the original nif to remove the original windows and replace them with prettier ones from the vanilla game.

The Stormcloak Cabin Resource is used largely in the Northeast District, where it is the main structure used for the Pub, the Warehouse, portions of the Gatehouse, and Residences 3-6. It is also used to add the wolf heads to the Western Fort.

The Castle Modders Resource is used for the Western Fort, the Dockside Keep, and the Eastern Tower.

The Manor House Modders Resource provided some chimney pieces with a convenient shape, that I used for filler purposes around some roads or wall seams.

Otherwise, the rest of the base mod is made with vanilla Skyrim resources. I did some nif hacking for a few things, but did not introduce any real custom assets.

## Permissions

All of my permissions are fully open. Anyone is allowed to fork my base mod however they like. All I ask is a small credit as original author and nothing more.

Note that there is one other limitation. The original author of Stormcloak Cabin Resource requires any mods made with it to be distributed only on the Nexus. Therefore, for as long as you keep the Stormcloak Cabin Resource objects in your fork of my mod, you must distribute it only on the Nexus. For more details please see [the mod page for Stormcloak Cabin Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66514).

My permissions do not apply to any addons created for my base mod. For any addons that may eventually be made for the base mod, please consult with addon authors.
