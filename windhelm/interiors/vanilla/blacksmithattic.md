# Windhelm Blacksmith Quarters Attic

![](/windhelm/pics/blacksmithattic.png?raw=true "Blacksmith Quarters Attic Entrance")

Since the wallwalks exist now, a new door has been added to the roof of Blacksmith Quarters that links the attic to the walls. In the same wall-level junction are also stone steps that leads down directly to the market.

What can we use this attic space for? My current idea is that perhaps it should be made into a home for Hermir Strong-Heart, Oengul's apprentice. It feels to me kind of odd that the two of them, being master-apprentice in relationship, would sleep right next to each other like a married couple.

Do note that the vanilla Blacksmith Quarters interior does include what would've been the attic space. This means 2 things can be done in an addon: either we build the vanilla interior to add ladders and floor to the attic level, and then put the door there, or we simply block up the vanilla space's upper portions with a flat roof, and then create the attic in an entire new cell. If the latter, then perhaps thought should be given regarding whether it makes sense for the attic and the vanilla interior to have an additional linkage, or whether the attic is an entirely separate unit accessible only from the outside.

Of course, this attic space is also ripe for a small player home similar in style to Astronomer's Loft by aureoy.

> Note: You may wonder why that exterior door protrudes out so much. The reason I had to protrude it out that much is because that's how far the Blacksmith Quarters nif's stupid collision box protrudes out. If doors are behind the collision box, you won't be able to hover the cursor over to activate it. This is not fixable without the ability to edit nif collision, and I have no idea how to do that. If an expert want to help with this part of the problem, then I'm more than willing to make the door more flush with the actual wall of the building.
