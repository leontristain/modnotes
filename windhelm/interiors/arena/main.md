One thing Epic Windhelm Expansion Base does is restores the Windhelm Arena structure. This structure is located to the east of Palace of the Kings, and accessible via cross paths at the prison building. Heading north from the prison building, you end up at the Windhelm Arena gate, where before you is the Arena gate itself, and behind you is a separate door that leads into the prison building.
