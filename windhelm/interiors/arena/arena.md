# Windhelm Arena Worldspace

The main door of the arena will lead to the "WindhelmPitWorld" worldspace containing the interior of Windhelm Arena. Currently there are a bunch of NPC spectators here that greet and do nothing else. Again, most likely this should be used in an effort to restore the Windhelm Arena content. Again, perhaps it can be patched to integrate with Faction: Pit Fighter.
