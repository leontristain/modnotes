The top half of Windswept Manor, dubbed the "Suite" is the most coveted subdivision. I see this space to be turned into the fanciest out of Windhelm player homes. Size-wise it's similar to Hjerim, but it's located at a really cool part of the city. The killer feature here is that it has private access to Windswept Manor's balcony, which is not only large and and spacious, but also offers a beautiful view of the city below, the beacon above, and the mountains in the distance.

Ideally, there should be some kind of backstory as to why someone have not purchased it yet. The player should be able to obtain it through some kind of small quest.
