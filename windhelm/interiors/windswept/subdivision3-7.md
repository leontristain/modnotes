# Windswept Manor Subdivisions 03, 04, 05, 06, 07

Subdivisions 03 to 07 are smaller subdivisions that only take up one floor, with some on the first level and some on the second. The bottom subdivisions may have doors that opens right into the cafeteria area, which makes it rather lively, and this could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the resident's personality.
