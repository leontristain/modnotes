# Stonemasonry Guild

The massive wood-and-stone house next to the bank is the Stonemasonry Guild. That's my idea anyway, and again you don't have to go with what I'm thinking on any of these buildings - feel free to do whatever you like.

I thought of the stonemasonry guild when I saw that there are existing NPCs that simply walks over to various windows and hammer them as their day jobs. With all the new expanded space, there is a need to keep all the roads populated with pedestrians to keep things lively.

Windhelm is a city made of stone. Everything is stone, from the massive walls to the buildings to the brick steps on the ground. I imagine throughout its history, stonemasonry must be a very mature trade that goes back endless generations. Windhelm is also in no shortage of stonework, since many areas - vanilla areas in particular, are full of _broken_ stone that are just asking to be repaired.

So, what more lore-friendly way to keep the streets lively by creating a guild of stone workers who file out of their guildhouse in the morning, and then throughout the day, walk from place to place hammering at stone? Between them all, they could cover every part of the city and walk every path. Hence, the Stonemasonry guild. Maybe they could develop their own fraternity ways complete with enigmatic emblems and complex rituals and have some folks base conspiracy theories on them.
