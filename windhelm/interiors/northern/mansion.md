# Northern District Mansion and Servants Quarters

This is a large private mansion built right next to Palace of the Kings. It has a mini-courtyard with a side door that leads to the Servant Quarters, which could be its own interior or simply a part of the same main interior.

I see the resident here to be an upper class Thane of a large and great house, with questionable personality - maybe the Erikur of Windhelm, except perhaps less disloyal but a lot more bigoted. Perhaps folks like Rolff Stone-Fist behave the way they do because of the way this prominent, influential Thane acts in public.
