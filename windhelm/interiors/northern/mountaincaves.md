# Mountain Caves

On the northwest edge of Windhelm where it touches the mountain, there exists a large, epic gate that leads into the mountain.

I see this as the entrance for a large, open, cavernous interior that is to Windhelm as the Glittering Caves is to Helm's Deep. Perhaps there could be more people and communities living within, or perhaps it could largely be just patroled by soldiers. These caves should be easily defended from Windhelm's side, yet also connect to various other parts of Tamriel so that it may be used as an escape route should Windhelm ever be helplessly besieged. Perhaps parts of the caves even lead further down into vile, dangerous places that few have explored (is Blackreach too much of a stretch?).

A known and well-utilitized path, however, is the cavern path that ascends and leads out slightly to the southwest, and there we have the door that leads out to Windhelm's Beacon, where you can then descend the steep stairs back down to the Western District. I imagined that should Windhelm be breached by enemies and its defenses entirely pushed into the mountain cave, the Beacon is still an area of easy defense due to the steep and narrow stairs, so defending soldiers could peek out from there to look at the situation below.
