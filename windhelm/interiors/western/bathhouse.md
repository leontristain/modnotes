At the bottom of a cozy alley opposite of the temple, sort of "built into the mountains" is the Windhelm Bathhouse. This alley is normally quiet, and in the midst of winter, could be quite cold. But all that would contrast with the warmth offered by the bathhouse, which could have steam coming out of pipes nearby that evaporates into the air above.

The "building" the door belongs on is in reality more of a facade, for directly behind it is the mountain itself. Thus, the interiors are actually hollowed-out caves that have been engineered into a bathhouse, though with nicely finished interiors, you may not be able to see traces of it other than the lack of windows on the inside.

Located where it is, imagine folks coming out of the Meadhall walking down the alley and into the bathhouse for a nice warm bath, before heading back to their residences and apartments to retire for the night. Though located in the Western District, it's not far from the Northern District, and Valunstrad is just on the other side of the High Road as well.
