Surrounding the meadhall are other Western District buildings containing 3 doors that lead into interiors. Doors 01, 02, and 03 are right in the same alleyway as the Meadhall Apartments, whereas Doors 04 is on the other side rather out of the way, where it faces Windswept Manor and is close to the staircase up to Windhelm's Beacon.

I can see doors 01, 02, and 03 being either homes or shops. Shops probably make a lot of sense - there's enough room to display your wares, and this alley should get plenty of foot traffic. Maybe you're a tailor who sells clothes. Maybe you're an apothecary who sells medicine. Your first floor would be your storefront, while you live on the second floor.

Door 04, which leads into a Brunwulf-style house, is a bit different. It's very out of the way, making it one of the most remote houses in Windhelm. The person who decides to live here is probably more of an introvert who prefers a more peaceful, solitary existence. Perhaps this could be the home to the maintainer for the beacon, where every day on a set schedule he would climb the stairs up high to refuel the beacon, and that's his role in life. Door 04's proximity to Windswept Manor also means the person living there would probably go into the Windswept Manor Commons for food and socializing more often than the Meadhall.
