![](/windhelm/pics/westerndistrictoverview.png?raw=true "Western District Overview")

Vanilla Windhelm's western walls has been repurposed into the High Road - a broad, wide, raised avenue that runs down the western center of the city. The Western District is the portion of the city that lies to the west of the High Road. To its east, it links directly to the market square underneath a bridge. To its north, it joins up at the end of the high road, ascending up to the mountain cave gate and the Northern district beyond.
