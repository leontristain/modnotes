On the backside of the Meadhall building, we have 3 doors. These to me says "apartments". They likely lead to fairly modest-sized living spaces that are each rather thin and short but maybe have 2 levels in a loft-like arrangement.

Folks living here probably don't have a lot of means or prefer the simple life. You exchange space and luxuries for convenience of living right next to the pub, the temple, the shops, and the bathhouse down the street, and within easy walking distance to the market. You don't have much, but the neighborhood is safe and lively and you rather enjoy that.
