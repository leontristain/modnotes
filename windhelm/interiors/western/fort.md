At the western end of the southern walls is the Western Fort. This defensive structure marks the westernmost point of the City of Windhelm, and serves as the stronghold that anchors the wall into the mountain.

The main entrance of the fort goes right onto the western wall. Additionally its rooftop is also accessible. From there, soldiers can keep watch on any potential enemies coming from the direction of Anga's Mill, as well as any shenanigans that may happen on the westward road.

With the wallwalks, there should be a lot of soldiers on patrol all the time. These soldiers need to sleep somewhere, which would likely be the various forts, keeps, and storehouses along the walls. The Western Fort is the largest wall structure, so its interiors would probably house a lot of beds and living quarters for wall soldiers. Perhaps there could be a prominent guard captain in charge of the southern walls, and this captain would have his or her own captain's quarters in the fort.
