# Meadhall

![](/windhelm/pics/meadhall.png?raw=true "The Meadhall")

The Meadhall is a building located on the other side of the bridge from the market square. If you ate your bread and produce from the Bakery and Hillevi's stand, you could simply turn the corner and be at the Meadhall for feasts and drink. You won't miss it. It's got enormous barrels of mead right outside the door.

My first thought for this building is that, well it's gotta be a pub, right? The Western District is far away from Candlehearth Hall, so it would be nice if residents didn't have to trek so far in the middle of the night for their pints. The Meadhall would serve as the western pub of the city, in comparison to Candlehearth being the center pub, and New Gnisis Cornerclub being the eastern one.

My second thought for this building is that perhaps it could also serve as the home base for a traditional adventurer's guild in RPGs. The pub would serve customers but also register adventurers into the guild and manage quests and bounties. More radiant quests is always a good thing, why not find a way to add more?

Another idea is for the Meadhall to be a pub-meadery hybrid. It's functionally a pub/adventurer's guild hybrid, but the family/company behind the Meadhall are also mead producers that competes with Black-Briar and Honningbrew. Perhaps they don't have as much market share so it's more of a very local specialty. Overall I imagine it would make a lot of sense for the hardy folks of Windhelm to have some alcohol to call their own.

Another interesting thought is, why are they leaving out huge barrels of mead outside in the snowy winter? Wouldn't it freeze? Isn't that bad for the mead? Being someone with very little knowledge of alcohol culture, this bothered me, so I looked it up. Apparently freeze-distillation of mead is a real thing and it results in a stronger mead called "honeyjack". Now I don't know how practical it is to do it in gigantic barrels, but meh, the barrels look cool and epic, and we can think of some handwavey explanations to remain lore-friendly.
