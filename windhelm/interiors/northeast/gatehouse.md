# Northeast Gatehouse

The Northeastern Gates out of the city is built with a massive Gatehouse that is at least as epic in splendor, if not even more so, than the main entrance to the city's south. The Gatehouse has a lower access door on its southern side, and two upper access doors at the wallwalk level that open in both directions along the wall. The wallwalk level also has convenient locations where defenders can watch the roads below.

While the gameplay constraints with such buildings means the interior is an entirely different cell where you can't actually look out from inside the gatehouse, or defend against invaders with arrow slits and murder holes, I think its mere existence can provide a realism boost. Also, I think it's totally possible to add a portcullis to the gate, which will happen in another iteration soon.
