# Northeast District Temple

![](/windhelm/pics/northeasttemple.png?raw=true "Northeast Temple Entrance")

The Northeast District also has its own temple, since other temples are rather far away and worship is a large part of Skyrim folks. The temple building itself is equal in size to the Temple of Talos, which makes it a bit bigger than the Western District Temple. However, it's also placed on lower elevation right against the side of a wall, which makes it feel less prominent. I also see only the front portion of the building to be used as the actual temple, while the backside of the building could be used for something else.
