# Northeast Warehouse

Built into the walls is another Stormcloak Cabin Resource building that I'm calling the Northeast Warehouse. Given its location, I am currently envisioning this to be a supply room or warehouse for the city guards. It could perhaps also be turned into a stable for horses, if it makes sense for horses to be able to go in and out of those normal rectangular doors.
