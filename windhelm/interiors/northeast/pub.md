The Northeast District Pub is the pub that serves this Northeast District. From the Northeast District, you're pretty far away from all other pubs - including the New Gnisis Cornerclub, so it makes sense for the district to also have its own pub. The pub is located at the end of a street, and is built right into the side of the Northeast Castle on the northern side of the district.
