# Northeast District Residences 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06

The Northeast District is a modest, sleepy, no-frills district. It's not a place where fancy thanes would live. These 6 houses make up the living quarters of ordinary citizens of this district. Out of the houses, 01 and 02 are Brunwulf-style houses, while 03, 04, 05, and 06 are custom assets ("Stormcloak Cabin Resource by Kraeten). 01 and 02 line the western walls, while 03-06 form a block of residences within the middle of the district.
