# Addon Ideas

## The Public Buildings

It's fairly important to get implementations of these up front, since other addons may want to make use of these in their NPC daily schedules.

### Meadhall

Come up with the setting for the Meadhall. So far I've thought of the following ideas:

* The Meadhall is a pub. Inside there should be chairs, tables, bars, etc... fitting for a pub. There should be servers and pub keeper to speak to for ordering food and drink. There should be a bard being employed to entertain folks who come in.
* The Meadhall is a meadery business. It serves its own mead. Thus mead barrels should be a strong element of the aesthetics. The family secret to the mead made here is that it is freeze-distilled in the Windhelm snow, making it stronger and fitting for a hardy Windhelm nord. This is also why there are barrels outside in the snow. The family makes great mead but is not very savvy when it comes to exporting and competing in faraway markets, which makes it more of a local specialty. Perhaps one quest could be to help the family business by convincing the inns of Whiterun and Riften to sell this mead.
* An Adventurer's Guild also operates out of the guild. On a wall there are bounties and quests for the player to take. These would be radiant quests similar in style to The Notice Board or Missives. There is also a guild manager working behind a desk in a corner. In order to partake in these quests, you need to register with the guild. Afterwards you are free to take the quests from the board, or ask the manager for secret quests that are more complex/dangerous but with greater rewards. The Adventurer's guild is a neutral entity and not involved with the Civil War. Occasionally other guild members are around and nearby. You may be able to take them on as hirelings.

The family that owns the Meadhall works the floor during the day, and sleeps upstairs at night.

### Windhelm Bathhouse

Implement the interiors of the Windhelm Bathhouse. This is a Bathhouse built into the mountains. The interior should not have any windows. Most parts of the interior should be finished but some doors can realistically lead into natural caverns. It should not be overly opulent since the overall Western District is not a lavish district, but it should be nice and comfortable and cozy enough such that it can believably be a source of daily comfort for Windhelm folks who live hearby.

It should have enough capacity that during evening hours many people living nearby might be here at the same time.

As a bathhouse, the interior aesthetics should be steamy. Folks entering the bath should automatically undress upon entering the water (there are some player castle mods, such as Skystone Castle that have this feature). There should be a servant who cleans various places around the bath. There may be furnaces or dwemer machinery to be seen keeping the water temperature maintained.

Outside the bathhouse door, there should be a pipe somewhere that would constantly let out steam into the alley outside. There should be a sign that advertises that this is the Windhelm Bathhouse.

### Windswept Manor Commons Clutter

Add clutter such as dishes, plates, food items, mead barrels, and all sorts of decorations etc... to the Windswept Manor Commons. Maybe add a notice board to the wall with quirky notes. Add idle markers for sweeping, leaning against wall, etc...

### Windswept Manor Kitchen

Implement the Windswept Manor Kitchen as a kitchen. Add a Chef NPC and a helper NPC. Choose a place for them to live. Perhaps they could live in one of the Windswept Manor subdivisions, or perhaps only the Chef lives in a subdivision while the helper need to commute from elsewhere in the city (e.g. maybe one of the apartments).

The chef's primary job is to cook in the kitchen, and periodically walk the halls. The helper sometimes helps the chef in the kitchen, and sometimes cleans the commons.

### Northeast District Pub

This is a simple pub. Inside should be chairs, tables, bars, etc... fitting for a pub. There should be servers and pub keeper to speak to for ordering food and drink. There may be a bard who would come in occasionally to play music and sing songs.

This pub primarily serves the Northeast District. It doesn't have to be as complicated as the Meadhall. It could simply be just a simple pub and nothing more. Owners sleep upstairs.

## Standalone Building Addons

These are some more standalone building/NPC ideas.

### Windhelm Bakery

Implement the Windhelm Bakery interior. The interior should focus on the presence of chimneys, ovens, and lots and lots and lots of bread. The owner of the bakery should be an NPC that lives and works in the building. Upstairs there is a small sleeping quarters for that NPC. The Bakery should have daily open hours where the NPC works.

The exterior of the building should have a chimney with smoke expelling out, and a sign in front of the door for the bakery.

### Windhelm Bakery Deliverer

In addition to the Windhelm Bakery, another NPC works at the Windhelm Bakery every day. This NPC lives in one of the apartments behind the Meadhall, so the interior for the apartment should be built out. The NPC goes to work at the Bakery in the morning. His day job is to deliver bread to the 5 pubs in the city:

 - Windswept Manor Commons
 - Meadhall
 - Candlehearth Hall
 - New Gnisis Cornerclub
 - Northeast District Pub

It would be cool if the NPC can wear a big basket backpack, and have an inventory full of bread.

### Blacksmith Quarters Attic

Implement the Blacksmith Quarters Attic as its own separate interior cell. In order to maintain immersion, floor pieces should be added to the Blacksmith Quarters vanilla cell to block off the roof level from view. The new attic space will be the new home for Hermir Strong-Heart, Oengul's apprentice.

Since Hermir is a big fan of Ulfric, maybe add some Ulfric fan items in the room. Since the building is a blacksmith and likely owned by Oengul, maybe it could double as a storage space for extra stocks of weapons and armor (that could quickly be distributed to the wallwalk in case of battle). Overall perhaps the room should reflect frugality and practicality, since Oengul and Hermir embodies "working class" of Windhelm, so they are likely not opulent.

### The Beacon Light Keeper

The Beacon Light Keeper is a rather solitary dude with one job - to keep the Beacon of Windhelm lit. He lives in the Western District Residence 04 building (one closest to the Beacon stairs). Every day, his job is to chop firewood. Then he would walk up the stairs to the Beacon and perform some action to keep the beacon burning. Then he would chill up there for a bit before descending back down.

Occasionally, the Beacon Light Keeper visits Windswept Manor Commons or the Meadhall for socializing. Otherwise he mostly just keeps to himself.

The purpose of the beacon is to serve as a lighthouse of sorts for folks traveling by land. Travelers would see Windhelm's beacon from far, far away, knowing that all they need to do is follow it and they will not get lost. Thus it is important to keep the beacon fed, every day.

### Windhelm Bank

The Windhelm Bank is the institution that serves as the financial backbone of the city's functions. From the player's perspective, the bank offers the following services:

 - Allow the player to invest money into various ventures, which could win or lose money for the player. This can be used as a form of money deposit (but there's always the risk that your deposited money can decrease in value). The "ventures" includes various businesses around Windhelm. One way for the player to make money is to deposit money into the venture and then do quests for the business owners. For example, if you put money into the Meadhall and then helped them sell their Mead at Whiterun and Riften, you will get a share of the profit.
 - Allow the player to take out loans. How much you can take out depends on your general status with Windhelm, which is a combination of your renown (e.g. Thaneship is good, helped Ulfric win the civil war is good, etc...), the amount of investment you've made in the past, and the number of property you own in the city (e.g. if you got the Windswept Manor Suite that will help). Loans must be paid back in due time, late payment means greater interest. If you cannot pay back debt, eventually your property will be taken from you (Windswept Manor Suite will lock its doors), and then debt collectors will be sent after you. The collectors will want to take items of value away from you. If you refuse, a fight will ensue and killing them will mean you get a Windhelm bounty.
 - Allow the player to purchase property - specifically, Windswept Manor Suite. There should probably be a quest that goes beyond simply "pay X Septims". Maybe there is some kind of investigation you need to complete first before the property is legally for sale. A Windhelm Bank mod that integrates Windswept Manor Suite does not have to build out the suite itself. It only needs to control the suite interior door's lock/key information, making it possible for other addons to build out the suite interior separately.

The Windhelm Bank should have a few bankers working behind desks and counters.

### Stonemasonry Guild

Build out the interior of the Stonemasonry Guild. The Stonemasonry Guild serves as the home to a fraternal organization that upkeeps Windhelm's long history of Stonemasonry traditions. All the stonework of Windhelm from the walls to the gates to the roads to the massive buildings everywhere are testament to the quality of their craft. New apprentices join the guild and get trained up to become journeymen, and those with the greatest experience become Grandmasters, who are in charge of epic projects whenever they come up. Feel free to add quirky symbols that could incite conspiracy theories.

The Guildhouse should have a large interior with many sleeping quarters for the apprentice. Many apprentices and journeymen operate from the guild. In the morning, they file out of the guild to perform their daily tasks, which involves walking all over Windhelm and hammering at various walls, piles of stones, and buildings. Each would have a different path to cover, where they hammer for a while at one thing before walking to the next thing to hammer. Once they finish their daily work, they are allowed some free time before heading back to the guild. Thus you can end up seeing stone masons taking a break at any one of the five pubs, since their route could take them anywhere within the city.

From a gameplay and immersion perspective, these stonemasons also serve the crucial purpose of adding to the city's foot traffic along new roads added by the expansion. Because they have long routes to cover, those routes can be designed to go anywhere, and thus it's good to have them cover places few other NPCs are likely to go.

## The City Guard

The city guard's responsibility is to man the wallwalks and keep it patrolled. The wall walks are divided into 3 sections:

 - The Southern Wallwalk
 - The Gray Quarters Wallwalk
 - The Northeast Wallwalk

Each of the wallwalk sections have a structure where guards can sleep and eat. The Southern Wallwalk guards operate out of the Western Fort. The Gray Quarters Wallwalk guards operate out of the Dockside Keep. The Northeast Wallwalk guards operate out of the Northeast District Castle.

Each center of operations should have interiors built out with barracks-style guard quarters where guards sleep, and barebones common area where guards eat. The Western Fort, being the largest of these military structures and furthest from the Palace of the Kings, should also have a captain's quarters located on a high floor. A captain NPC is stationed here. One cool thing the captain NPC can do is to ride a horse to patrol the entire length of the wallwalk.

Each of the 3 sections can be built out independently. Note that the Dockside Keep wallwalk area (area above East Empire Company structure) is considered part of the Gray Quarters Wallwalk, however the small bit of higher-elevation wallwalk to the east of the Southern Gate should be considered part of the Southern Wallwalk (so that we occasionally see guards crossing the gate bridge). The Stairs leading down to Dockside Keep is where the boundary would be drawn.

Ideally, the guards should switch allegiance accordingly following the outcome of the civil war. Should the Empire win, they should become Empire guards. The guard captain can remain the same person, and we can explain in lore that the city guards and the Stormcloak military are two separate but symbiotic organizations during the civil war, but from the Empire's perspective the Stormcloak military was the real enemy while the guards were only doing their jobs defending the city.

## Any-Purpose Interiors

The following are sort of "generic" residence-like interiors that could serve for the home of any sensible NPC. Any of them can also be turned into shops:

* Meadhall Apartments 01-03
* Western District Residences 01-04
* Windswept Manor Subdivisions 01-07
* Northern District Residences 01-03
* Northeast District Residences 01-06
* Northeast District Temple Back

## Temples

The expansion adds two temples:

* Western District Temple
* Northeast District Temple

Together with the vanilla Temple of Talos, they make up the 3 Temples of the city (sort of like the 5 Pubs).

The Western District Temple is intended to be an iconic landmark of the city. It addresses the complaint that the vanilla Temple of Talos is not epic enough to be prominent and iconic. Though the Western District Temple is technically the same building and don't even have the backside, thus making it physically smaller on the outside, its sheer height and its location relative to its surroundings makes it very epic and iconic.

People have suggested that this can be:

 - Temple of Kyne/Kynareth, with side altars for Shor and Mara
 - Temple of the Nine Divines, as a Stormcloak-themed counter-pilgrimage site to Solitude's Temple of the Divines. Perhaps the gods shall be referred to by their Nordic names.
 - Relocate the vanilla Temple of Talos to here and use that building for something else.

The Northeast District Temple is intended to give the Northeast District folks a place to worship that doesn't require them to journey all the way across the city. Despite it technically being a larger structure, its location and context makes it much more low key compared to the Western District Temple. There is a back door to the building, which I think does not have to be part of the temple, and instead can be a home, shop, museum, library, or perhaps school for children.
