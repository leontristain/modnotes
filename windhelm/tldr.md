# Overview

## The Big Picture

This mod is an City Expansion mod for Windhelm.

It makes Windhelm a lot bigger. How much bigger? Check it out.

In the expanded Windhelm, the wallwalks are now accessible. You can now climb up to the walls and dramatically gaze into the distance, perhaps with your HDT cloak fluttering in the wind.

More importantly, the wallwalks of Windhelm form into a very nice road network which you can see here:

The expansion expands Windhelm towards its west, north, and northeast directions, with the wallwalks nicely partitioning out 3 new districts. The expansion also restores the Windhelm Arena structure, expands the size of the market square by a bit, and adds a number of structures to the Gray Quarters wallwalk level. All of these are shown by the following pic.

In the new districts, the mod adds a lot of new buildings, landmarks, points of interests, and doors to interiors, as shown by the following pic.

## Beautiful Visuals

I tried to make the expanded city look very beautifully epic, and I think I'm pretty proud of what I ended up with. The following are a few screenshots hand-picked for their postcard-worthy prettiness.

First and foremost, we have this epically long Southern Wallwalk.

In the Western District, we now have an epic temple structure currently dubbed the "Western District Temple". Here's a bird's eye view of it from the sky.

You also get some of these cozy alleyways, like the alleyway just outside the neighborhood bathhouse.

The top suite of the Windswept Manor building is intended to be a player home, and it's got the following killer balcony view.

As evening falls and windows become noticeably lit, here's a photo of the Western District's High Road looking northward showing the city in all its majesty, and the burning Beacon of Windhelm on the cliffs above.

At the northwest corner of the city there is a massive gate that leads into the mountains, perhaps leading to a Windhelm's equivalent for the Glittering Caves behind Helm's Deep.

The mansion in the Northern District, complete with its stone arch entrance.

A courtyard just inside the gates, located in the Northeast District, with stairs that ascend up into the Eastern Tower.

The Northeast Gatehouse in all its glory.

The Northeast Castle

Looking south from the Northeast Castle's railing, you first see the roofs of the Northeast District Residences, followed by the Northeast District Temple, and then the Dockside Keep in the distance on the other side of Gray Quarters.

On the backside of Windhelm Arena and Palace of the Kings, we have a courtyard leading to a massive statue of Talos.
