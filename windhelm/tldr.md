It makes Windhelm a lot bigger. How much bigger? Check it out.

In the expanded Windhelm, the wallwalks are now accessible. You can now climb up to the walls and dramatically gaze into the distance, perhaps with your HDT cloak fluttering in the wind.

More importantly, the wallwalks of Windhelm form into a very nice road network which you can see here:

The expansion expands Windhelm in the west, north, and northeast directions, with the wallwalks nicely partitioning out 3 new districts. The expansion also restores the Windhelm Arena structure, expands the size of the market square by a bit, and adds a number of structures to the Gray Quarters wallwalk level. All of these are shown by the following pic.

In the new districts, the mod adds a lot of new buildings, landmarks, points of interests, and doors to interiors, as shown by the following pic.
