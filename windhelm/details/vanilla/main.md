# Vanilla Areas

For the large part, vanilla areas have not changed. However, the many edges of the vanilla areas now connect up to the wallwalk levels via stairs, and additional space have been made available for the marketplace square to its west. In these places we have opportunities for some new doors that lead to interiors.

The following are available interiors for vanilla areas.
