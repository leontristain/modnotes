# Vanilla Areas

Vanilla Windhelm is mostly untouched, with the exception of parts that border newly expanded Windhelm. You can read details of vanilla area edits [here](/windhelm/details/vanilla/vanillaedits.md).

One part that was somewhat touched is the market square, which got expanded by about half its original size. In and around the market square, we now have 2 new doors that can lead into interiors:

* [Windhelm Bakery](/windhelm/details/vanilla/bakery.md)
* [Windhelm Blacksmith Quarters Attic](/windhelm/details/vanilla/blacksmithattic.md)
