# Notable Vanilla Edits

Windhelm's main south gate has been augmented with a "bridge" in order to allow the wallwalk to cross the gate from above. This "bridge" piece ended up adding a bit more to the footprint of the gate, which blocked navmesh access to the corner on the left side of the gate. Since that corner seems largely useless, I disabled the navmesh there entirely with a NAVCUT box. These are circled below.

Windhelm's new southern wallwalk needed to be accessible, so I added some thin stairs along the southern side of the road that leads to the market. This is also circled below.
