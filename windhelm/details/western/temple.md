# Western District Temple

![](/windhelm/pics/westerntemple.png?raw=true "Western District Temple")

Across from the Meadhall Apartments, and adjacent to the High Road, is the massive, towering structure of the Western District Temple. This temple is one of the icons of this part of the city, being itself taller than many buildings across the city to its east.

This building is the same structure as the Temple of Talos, just without the back portion that goes above Hall of the Dead, which actually makes it technically smaller, despite its location and elevation making it look more massive and epic. It has 2 doors, a front door that faces south, and a back door that faces north.

Folks have suggested what kind of temple this could be. I've heard that it is good for it to be a temple to Kyne/Kynareth, for she is the origin of the Thu'um and the mother of the Nords, who, since the death of Shor, is considered the chief diety of the Nord Pantheon. Within such a temple, it may make sense to have smaller shrine rooms to Shor and perhaps also to Mara, Kyne's handmaiden.

Another idea brought up by folks is that it could be a temple to the entire Nordic Pantheon, that highlights Windhelm's Stormcloak position by having it worship all nine divines in contrast to Solitude's Temple of the Divines. This could be a counter-pilgrimage site, and the divines could be addressed by old Nordic Pantheon names. Perhaps Ulfric made this happen to forge a new nationalistic identity (or, the equivalent of propaganda, if you spin it negatively).
