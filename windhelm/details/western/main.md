# Western District

![](/windhelm/pics/westerndistrictoverview.png?raw=true "Western District Overview")

Vanilla Windhelm's western walls has been repurposed into the High Road - a broad, wide, raised avenue that runs down the western center of the city. The Western District is the portion of the city that lies west of the High Road. It has direct road access to the market square, the southern wallwalk, and the high road itself, which gives it decent access to Valunstrad and the Northern District.

Folks living in the Western District live among cozy alleyways and like to visit the Meadhall for mead and warmth. Right next to them is the city's tallest temple. At the westernmost end of the western district is [Windswept Manor](/windhelm/details/windswept/main.md), a massive building built into the side of the mountain. Within the building is actually a separate enclave community that is almost large enough to be its own district.

From Windswept Manor, one can climb up the steep steps up to the Beacon of Windhelm.
