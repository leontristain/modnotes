At the western end of the southern walls is the Western Fort. This defensive structure marks the westernmost point of the City of Windhelm, and serves as the stronghold that anchors the wall into the mountain.

The main entrance of the fort goes right onto the western wall. Additionally its rooftop is also accessible. From there, soldiers can keep watch on any potential enemies coming from the direction of Anga's Mill, as well as any shenanigans that may happen on the westward road.

With the wallwalks, there should be a lot of soldiers on patrol all the time. These soldiers need to sleep somewhere, which would likely be the various forts, keeps, and storehouses along the walls. The Western Fort is the largest wall structure, so its interiors would probably house a lot of beds and living quarters for wall soldiers. Perhaps there could be a prominent guard captain in charge of the southern walls, and this captain would have his or her own captain's quarters in the fort.

> Note: The nif for the building comes from Castle Modders Resource by Tlaffoon. The building itself is the main keep from Tlaffoon's castle, but resized for a better fit with the wall. The building was originally designed to have external interiors (so there are actually inside parts in that nif), but the scale of course makes that no longer usable as-is, and we wanted an interior cell for it anyway.

> The castle nif came with incomplete collision. Most parts do have collision, but the castle roof did not have collision, so I had to add a collision plane to the roof. Also, 2 of the 4 battlement sides on the roof did not have collision, which is why I added wooden railings into the battlements on all 4 sides. I do recognize that the battlements themselves are a bit on the small side due to the unfortunate scale of the castle, but this is the best I've got at the moment. In the future, I have an idea of further adding in some of the individual wall pieces from the castle mod, which could make the battlements bigger and maybe even look nicer. That will be done in a future pass.
