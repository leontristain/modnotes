# Northern District

![](/windhelm/pics/northerndistrictoverview.png?raw=true "Northern District Overview")

The Western District ends as the Bathhouse alleyway ascend up to join up with the High Road at the end of the Western District Temple. From that junction we could further ascend north into the Northern District.

The Northern District is located on the hills behind Valunstrad adjacent to the Palace of the Kings, which makes it the highest elevation of Windhelm City. Despite this, at ground level you don't actually get an expansive view of the city, due to the size of Valunstrad houses. The mood here is more of an intimate, tucked in community in one of the safest parts of the city.
