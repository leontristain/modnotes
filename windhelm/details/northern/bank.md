# Windhelm Bank

Beyond the massive Mountain Gate, the first building we chance upon is the Windhelm Bank, which serves as the financial backbone of the city's functions. Those who wish to set up shop would loan money and then pay back with profits. The bank also oversees commercial real estate within the city, so if you want to buy a house, perhaps you come here.
