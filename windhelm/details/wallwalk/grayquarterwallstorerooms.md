# Gray Quarter Wall Storeroom 01, 02

Due to vanilla Windhelm shenanigans, there is actually a good chunk of unused space where the Eastern Wall is to the Gray Quarters. Basically, the Tamriel Worldspace's walls there are actually some distance further to the east than the Windhelm Worldspace's walls, which means vanilla Windhelm's gray quarters is actually slightly smaller than the space carved out for it. This means when I restored the exterior walls into the Windhelm Worldspace, I ended up with two layers of walls at two different elevations. I considered using this space to expand the Gray Quarters, but that turned out to be unfeasible due to the lack  of flexibility of the Gray Quarter building nifs, where after trying many different ideas I could not find one that work well. Thus, I kept the two layers of walls, and added two wall-level doors into the elevation difference.

There's a lot of wall-level space here so I imagine the city guard could put a lot of guard activity into this area. Perhaps the wide space makes this a great area for guards to train and hone their fighting skills - something like the Castle Dour Courtyard. These interiors could be guard sleeping quarters, or simply storerooms for supply. Perhaps one of them could be an armory.
