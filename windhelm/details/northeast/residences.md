The Northeast District is a modest, sleepy, no-frills district. It's not a place where fancy thanes would live. These 6 houses make up the living quarters of ordinary citizens of this district. Out of the houses, 01 and 02 are Brunwulf-style houses, while 03, 04, 05, and 06 are [Stormcloak Cabin Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66514/) by Kraeten. 01 and 02 line the western walls, while 03-06 form a block of residences within the middle of the district.

These could be homes, shops, or both.
