# Northeast District Temple Back

![](/windhelm/pics/northeasttempleback.png?raw=true "Northeast Temple back door, this seems like it would be better to be a separate building and not the temple itself.")

This is the back side of the Northeast District Temple building, accessible via a side door right next to the stairs leading up the Eastern Tower. I think this interior could serve any purpose, such as a school, a library, a museum, or some kind of shop. Directly out the door is also a small square where some market stalls could be placed, which gives you a sense of the context.
