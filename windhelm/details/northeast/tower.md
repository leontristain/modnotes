The Eastern Tower is a circular tower that is part of the walls. This structure does not have any doors leading to interior cells, in that the insides of this structure is fully accessible entirely from the Windhelm Worldspace. It has 2 levels, a bottom level accessible via flights of stairs from the ground, a wall level, and a roof level. The levels are connected by spiraling stairs at the tower's center. This tower serves as an important access point between the ground level of the Northeast District and the eastern wallwalk. Lore-wise, you can say it's also an important tower to the city's northeast defenses.

The nif comes from [Castle Modders Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61709) by Tlaffoon, retextured with Windhelm stone. The floor have been paved with wooden planks in order to hide the snow shader that shows up "indoors" underneath - also wood is cozy is it's good to have anyway. The spiral stairs in the middle is narrow and steep, but I made sure that an NPC is capable of successfully navigating up and down it (albeit slowly) without getting stuck. This required me to add additional half-steps to each step, but now both the player and NPC can walk it fairly smoothly.

One unfortunate thing about that spiral stairwell is that two NPCs cannot walk past each other, and neither can player and an NPC (without mods that let player walk through NPCs, anyway). This can get frustrating at times.
