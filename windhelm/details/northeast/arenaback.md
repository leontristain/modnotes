Going through the Northeast Castle, and you would arrive at a "back garden" located behind the Windhelm Arena and adjacent - basically connecting right into - the Palace of the Kings. Here we have a large statue of Talos at the top of some stairs. More importantly, there's a door that leads into the building behind the Arena.

I actually don't see this space to be an Arena-related space. After all, the Arena interior doesn't leave much room to add more viewing capacity from that direction, and the Arena quest and backstory probably doesn't make it easy to integrate such a location. What I can see, however, is for this location to be an additional "wing" of the Palace of the Kings. That makes this door essentially a back door of sorts to the Palace of the Kings.

Or you can just make it into a mini-temple, a mini-museum, or some shop isolated to a corner of the city few people visit. Up to you.
