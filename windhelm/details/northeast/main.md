To the north of Gray Quarters is the Northeast District. Design-wise, this district serves two crucial purposes.

The first purpose is that Windhelm really lacks a gate to its north. The old Northern wall of Windhelm is right at the edge of the Gray Quarters, where it's 100% blocked off and there's no gate. Yet, what lies beyond the wall there is a perfectly flat piece of landscape that has basically nothing on it, and if you travel further down that direction, you can hike yourself on a much straighter path to Windhelm's closest ally of Winterhold. It made no sense that when the Empire is whole, they did not build the most obvious road between Windhelm and Winterhold, and no sense that after Ulfric started his rebellion, there wouldn't be a passage that goes straight to Winterhold whom sided with the Stormcloaks. Granted, we do have a few mods that let us access that area from the docks, but relying on the dock gate for such an access is awkward and roundabout. Hence, there should be a gate that opens directly into that direction.

In a previous iteration of the base mod, I added a gate from the Gray Quarters into that area. The responses I got suggests there are good lore-based arguments for that if there is a gate to the northeast, it should not be fully under the influence of the Gray Quarter, for back when that previous Jarl of Windhelm gave the Gray Quarter to the dunmer refugees, it would've only made sense if the neighborhood isn't part of the crucial defenses of the city. Thus, we now have a nord-majority Northeast district that contains this gate, with the Gray Quarters remaining a cull-de-sac.

The second purpose is that, with the restoration of Windhelm Arena, there is now the need for some kind of inner city area that surrounds the Arena's northeast side. Otherwise, the Arena building itself would've been half inside Windhelm and half outside, which is awkward and strange. At the same time, the Windhelm Arena restoration brought about a new building for the prison, where instead of the previous L-shaped path, the new building has a "+" shaped cross path, allowing the eastern walls to be naturally accessed. This provided the perfect access point for that northeast district, which otherwise would've been very difficult to access without entirely rebuilding the northern side of Gray Quarters, the prison tower itself, or Palace of the Kings - all of which are almost-impossible tasks.

The resulting Northeast District can be accessed from two directions. Right at the prison's crossroad, you can turn onto the northern Gray Quarter walls and then right around onto a set of stairs that descend into the Northeast District. Or, alternatively, you can approach along the wallwalk from the east side, where you can find your way down to the district's ground levels through the Eastern Tower or the Gatehouse.

The theme for the Northeast District is basically a castle town. It will feel like it's surrounded by fortifications on all sides. The biggest, most notable structures include a tower, a gatehouse, and a castle. The pub is built right into the side of the castle. This district will be a bit isolated from the rest of the city, so I imagine its people may develop a more local sub-identity.
