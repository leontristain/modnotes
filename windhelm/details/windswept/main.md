Located on the western edge of the city, Windswept Manor is a massive house built into the mountains. This house was first built by a thane who foolishly attempted to build a home larger than the Jarl's. Some told that he had business investments in the Snow Quarter back in the days, but when it was suddenly confiscated to house Dunmer migrants by an order from the Jarl, he found himself in total financial collapse. As a result, the bank forced him to sell off the manor to pay off his debts. The bank then subdivided the building into individual units to be resold to new owners.

As a result, though it looks like one house, the interior of Windswept Manor is more like a enclave community of its own. There are 7 subdivisions, a common kitchen, a common dining area with a nice fireplace, as well as a upper suite. The common areas, dubbed the "Windswept Manor Commons" can be considered a pub-like hangout, though managed to be more like a cafeteria. Residents of Windswept Manor normally live in their subdivided units, they would eat drink and hang out in the commons, and head out the city for work and trips.
