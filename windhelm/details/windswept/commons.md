The Windswept Manor Commons is the main hall of Windswept Manor. There are two wings and a long central hall lit on both sides by lanterns. Along the central hall are many benches for dining that forms a cafeteria of sorts. All of this are considered public space, and plays an important role to the social needs of the manor residents.

Doors from the commons leads into the subdivision units, which are privately owned.
