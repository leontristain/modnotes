# Windhelm Arena Entrance Area

![](/windhelm/pics/arenaarea.png?raw=true "Windhelm Arena Entrance Area")

One thing Epic Windhelm Expansion Base does is restores the Windhelm Arena structure. This structure is located to the east of Palace of the Kings, and accessible via cross paths at the prison building. Heading north from the prison building, you end up at the Windhelm Arena gate, where before you is the Arena gate itself, and behind you is a separate door that leads into the prison building.

Note that currently, the base mod only restores the _structures_ of the Windhelm Arena. It does not try to restore any quests or playable content. Eventually I plan to see what it means to patch this with existing Arena quest mods like Faction: Pit Fighter.
