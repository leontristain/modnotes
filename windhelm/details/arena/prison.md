# Windhelm Arena Prison

![](/windhelm/pics/arenaprison.png?raw=true "Windhelm Arena Prison Door")

This is the door that leads into the prison building. I think most likely, this door should be used in an effort to restore the Windhelm Arena content. Perhaps it can be patched to integrate with Faction: Pit Fighter.
