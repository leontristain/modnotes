# Epic Windhelm Expansion Base

![](/windhelm/pics/southwall.png?raw=true "An Epic Windhelm Expansion Mod")

## Overview

**Epic Windhelm Expansion Base** is my attempt at a Windhelm Expansion mod for Skyrim Special Edition. As far as I know, in concept this is the largest and most "expansive" city expansion mod for Windhelm that has ever been attempted. It tries to do the following:

* Expands Windhelm's city presence in the west, north, and northeast directions, resulting in 3 entirely new city districts.

* Restores and make accessible the wallwalks of Windhelm, turning them into a new road network to be used by player and NPCs.

* Repairs many problems of the Windhelm worldspace, such as missing/hidden terrains, missing standins for large external objects like the Windhelm Bridge, and the various imperfections in vanilla Gray Quarters buildings when viewed from nonstandard angles, making it so that Windhelm will look whole and complete no matter where you are.

* Provide a gate that exits to the flat snowy plains to Windhelm's northeast, allowing a more sensible and straightforward road to Winterhold to be connected.

* Implemented in ways that minimize compatibility concerns and maximize potential for further exterior expansions.

For a quick, basic walk-through of mod details (with lots of pretty pictures), please read [this overview](/windhelm/tldr.md).

## Why Is It A "Base"?

You may have noticed that it's called "Epic Windhelm Expansion *Base*", which begs the question of why it's a "base". To answer this let me start at the beginning.

I started working on this mod out of a random burst of creativity sometimes during U.S. Labor Day weekend. That particular weekend in 2020 on the U.S. west coast was not a nice place to be. There were massive wildfires throughout the west coast, and it was so bad that [San Francisco became a Daedric realm for a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBolnN8aiX8). Turned out, when you're hot and trapped indoors due to the heat wave, smoke, and bad air quality, it's pretty enticing to jump into Skyrim and obsess over one of its coldest cities with lots of fresh snow and crisp winter air.

By the end of it, I got a lot done. However, there were lots more to do still. Vacation was over, work was getting busy again, and I now have a lot less free time. Skyrim modding is also not the only priority in my life so it's quite possible I need to put it on the back burner for a while sooner or later. Given all that, and looking at the rest of the work, I estimate it would take me a year or more to actually get to a content-complete state, and I can't guarantee to work on this for that long. I think if left entirely to me, I might not get to the end at all. There's also the problem that the remaining work involves designing interiors, creating NPCs, writing dialogue and quests - all things that I'm not very good at.

The obvious solution to the above, which people kept on telling me, is to ask for help from the community. We have many very talented people in the community who could be interested in contributing to this project. We have many examples in the modding community where great mods were made by people picking up and improving previous work from others. An example is [Complete Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36061/), which led to [TRUE CITY - The Great Expansion of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60430/), which led to [Solitude Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63685), which finally led to [Enhanced Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27816) - our most epic Solitude Expansion mod today.

Therefore, I am asking for folks to help. I am doing this in two ways. The first is the bare minimum of any "community effort" so it's really just stating the obvious, but the second is what I'll be focusing on from now on.

1. All my permissions are completely open, so at the very basic level, anyone can "fork" my mod whenever and however they like.
2. I will continue working on my mod as a "base" mod, turning it into a robust base platform upon which other mod authors could create modular [addons](/windhelm/addons.md) without needing to worry about compatibility. This means folks are free to contribute self-contained content of any size or complexity, and have it seamlessly integrate into the base mod together with any other such addon from others, for as long as they follow [these guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md).

My "[base platform](/windhelm/base.md)" will have the responsibility to maintain a single vision for where major buildings are placed and where roads go, so that it can authoritatively provide the navmesh and door links for it. [Addon](/windhelm/addons.md) authors could then follow [these guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md) when building out interiors, adding NPCs, schedules, markers, clutter, and quest stuff, and we end up in a world where addons don't conflict between each other and the user can easily mix and match them.

Going forward, I plan to gradually work on the base platform content. The most crucial elements of the base platform are already done, but quality can be improved and many things can still be tweaked. As I work on base platform content, I will maintain a presence on the NexusMods page to communicate with addon authors and other interested folks and update the base platform accordingly.

Once the base platform is more or less "final", I will then prioritize on creating patches with other mods like JK's, DoS, and exterior expansion mods such as Windhelm Exterior Altered and Windhelm Docks Pathways (assuming others don't get there first). As long as addon authors follow [my guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md), these patches theoretically should be independent of addon mods so that addons don't need further patches of their own. Once patches are complete, I would then prioritize my time on filling in content that other addon authors have not chosen to work on. I will release my own work as addons as well.

## Are You Interested In Helping?

As an addon author, you have full creative control over what you build. Despite that I've already "named" many buildings and landmarks in my pictures and wiki pages here, the truth is really that nothing is set in stone. For example, there is nothing preventing anyone from taking the "Windhelm Bathhouse" structure, and build it out as a school or a hideout, or something else.

You are also free to have purely additive changes to the Windhelm worldspace content, so adding clutter outside, adding markers for NPC daily schedule, adding patrol routes for guards, etc... can all be done.

All I ask is you follow [these guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md) so that we maintain modularity and minimize/eliminate potential conflicts.

If you want to familiarize yourself with what structures and doors are available in the base mod, [This page](/windhelm/details.md) is the starting point to browse detailed information of the expanded areas. In individual pages about each building, I have detailed descriptions of what it is, how it works, and my thoughts and other people's thoughts for what it could be.

The NexusMods comments page for the base mod is also a great place to read past conversations and have discussions with other interested folks.

If you decide to work on something, I would love to be in the loop so that I know what's happening with the overall project. Again, you have full creative control and zero pressure. If you don't feel committed enough to want to announce your work, I can understand that, but if you feel that you're able and willing, then it would be great if you could keep me in the loop.
