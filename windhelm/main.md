# Epic Windhelm Expansion

![](/windhelm/pics/southwall.png?raw=true "An Epic Windhelm Expansion Mod")

## Overview

**Epic Windhelm Expansion** is my attempt at a Windhelm Expansion mod for Skyrim Special Edition. As far as I know, in concept this is the largest and most "expansive" city expansion mod for Windhelm that has ever been attempted. Epic Windhelm Expansion tries to do the following:

* Expands Windhelm's city presence in the west, north, and northeast directions, resulting in 3 entirely new city districts.

* Restores and make accessible the wallwalks of Windhelm, turning them into a new road network to be used by player and NPCs.

* Repairs many problems of the Windhelm worldspace, such as missing/hidden terrains, missing standins for large external objects like the Windhelm Bridge, and the various imperfections in vanilla Gray Quarters buildings when viewed from nonstandard angles, making it so that Windhelm will look whole and complete no matter where you are.

* Provide a gate that exits to the flat snowy plains to Windhelm's northeast, allowing a more sensible and straightforward road to Winterhold to be connected.

* Implemented in ways that minimize compatibility concerns and maximize potential for further exterior expansions.

For a quick, basic walk-through of mod details (with lots of pretty pictures), please read [this overview](/windhelm/overview.md). For details about each location in the expanded city, [look here](/windhelm/details.md).

## Current State Of The Mod

In the Windhelm Worldspace, the basic layout, structures, and building locations are finished. Vanilla fixups are complete. Windhelm worldspace has Tamriel worldspace standins for structures like Windhelm Bridge, and Tamriel worldspace has Windhelm worldspace standins for the expanded walls and new districts. All exteriors are fully navmeshed, and all doors are linked.

However, with the exception of the [Windswept Manor Commons](/windhelm/details/windswept/commons.md), no interior work have been done. The interior cells have been created as minimal stubs but nothing else. There are also no NPCs, merchants, quests, or other actual gameplay content in the newly expanded areas.

This means if you explore the mod now, you can explore the expanded Windhelm city without any issues. However the new areas will be empty, and if you enter any building doors you will see incomplete interiors.

Also, in the Windhelm worldspace, newly added districts are barebones spaces devoid of small-detail clutter and decorations.

## Call For Help

I started working on this mod out of a random burst of creativity sometimes during U.S. Labor Day weekend. That particular weekend in 2020 on the U.S. west coast was not a nice place to be. There were massive wildfires throughout the west coast, and it was so bad that [San Francisco became a Daedric realm for a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so-FcHTWEIY). Turned out, when you're hot and trapped indoors due to the heat wave, smoke, and bad air quality, it's pretty enticing to jump into Skyrim and obsess over one of its coldest cities with lots of fresh snow and crisp winter air.

By the end of it, I got a lot done. However, there were lots more to do still. Vacation was over, work was getting busy again, and I now have a lot less free time. Skyrim modding is also not the only priority in my life so it's quite possible I need to put it on the back burner for a while sooner or later. Given all that, and looking at the rest of the work, I estimate it would take me a year or more to actually get to a content-complete state, and I can't guarantee to work on this for that long. I think if left entirely to me, I might not get to the end at all. There's also the problem that the remaining work involves designing interiors, creating NPCs, writing dialogue and quests - all things that I'm not very good at.

The obvious solution to the above, which people kept on telling me, is to ask for help from the community. We have many very talented people in the community who could be interested in contributing to this project. We have many examples in the modding community where great mods were made by people picking up and improving previous work from others. An example is [Complete Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36061/), which led to [TRUE CITY - The Great Expansion of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60430/), which led to [Solitude Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63685), which finally led to [Enhanced Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27816) - our most epic Solitude Expansion mod today.

Therefore, I am asking for folks to help. I am doing this in two ways. The first is the bare minimum of any "community effort" so it's really just stating the obvious. The second is what I'll be focusing on from now on.

1. All my permissions are completely open, so at the very basic level, anyone can "fork" my mod whenever and however they like. This way, even if my efforts at this project fails at the end, whatever's complete can be carried on by someone else down the road.

2. I am soliciting interested folks to help out with interiors, NPCs, quests, clutter, etc... I have put in a lot of effort in fleshing out the current state of the mod as a "base platform", such that contributors can build "addons" upon it, to be released independently and eventually curated into "addon packs". The "base platform" handles all exterior navmesh and door links, and provides stub interior cells. For details, please see the [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md)

If you are interested to contribute, feel free to hit me up and we can have a chat. I maintain presence on NexusMods, reddit, and here on github. You are free to begin whenever and however. The [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md) should explain how I'm expecting contributions to play out. When you create addon mods, please follow [These Guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md).

## Going Forward

I hope to have enough folks interested with creating interiors, NPCs, quests, clutter, etc... as addons. Again please see [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md). Meanwhile, I will gradually work on the base mod. [This page contains a listing of anticipated future work for the base mod](windhelm/upcoming.md).

I expect my own progress on the base mod to be slow due to real life and other priorities. Hopefully the community can help make some progress on the content front, and we'll have this in a playable state. In addition to working on the base mod, I will also be maintaining online presence, answering questions, and helping out addon authors to what degree I can.
