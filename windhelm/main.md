# Epic Windhelm Expansion

![](/windhelm/pics/southwall.png?raw=true "An Epic Windhelm Expansion Mod")

## Overview

**Epic Windhelm Expansion** is my attempt at a Windhelm expansion mod for Skyrim Special Edition. As far as I know, in concept this is the largest and most "expansive" city expansion mod for Windhelm that has ever been attempted. Broadly speaking, **Epic Windhelm Expansion** tries to do the following:

* Expands Windhelm's city presence to the west, nort, and northeast directions, resulting in 3 entirely new city districts.
* Restores and makes accessible the wallwalks of Windhelm, turning them into picturesque and functional road network to be used by the player and NPCs.
* Repairs many problems in the vanilla Windhelm worldspace, such as missing or hidden terrains, missing standins for large external objects like the Windhelm Bridge, and various imperfections in vanilla Gray Quarters buildings when viewed from nonstandard angles. Overall, the fixes make Windhelm worldspace look whole and complete from any vantage point within the city walls.
* Provides a gate that exists to the flat snowy plains to Windhelm's northeast, allowing a more sensible and straightforward road to Winterhold to be paved.
* Implemented in ways that minimizes compatibility concerns and maximizes potential for further exterior expansions.

For a quick basic walk-through of mod details (with lots of pretty pictures), please read [this overview](/windhelm/overview.md).

For details about newly added buildings, landmarks, and other locations within the expanded city, please start browsing [this page](/windhelm/details.md).


## Current State Of The Mod

In the Windhelm worldspace, the basic layout, structures, and building locations are finished. The vanilla fixups are also complete as far as I can tell. We also have standins, whether it be Tamriel worldspace standins for Windhelm worldspace objects, or Windhelm worldspace standins for Tamriel worldspace objects. All exteriors are fully navmeshed, and all doors are properly linked to stub interior cells.

However, with the exception of the [Windswept Manor Commons](/windhelm/details/windswept/commons.md) (also see: [Is Windswept Manor Commons Part Of The Base Mod?](/windhelm/plan.md#is-windswept-manor-commons-part-of-the-base-mod)), no interior work have been done. There are also no NPCs, merchants, quests, or other actual gameplay content in the newly expanded areas. This means if you explore the mod now, you can explore the expanded Windhelm city without any issues. However, the new areas will be empty. All the doors are locked. If you unlock any door in the console and enter, you'll end up in the stub cell which is functional but will contain just a few pieces of floor and nothing else.

Also, the completed locations are fairly barebones and not decorated with clutter and small details.


## Call For Help

I started working on this mod out of a random burst of creativity sometimes during U.S. Labor Day weekend. That particular weekend in 2020 on the U.S. west coast was not a nice place to be. There were massive wildfires all over the west coast, and it was so bad that [San Francisco became a Daedric Realm for a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so-FcHTWEIY). Turned out, when you're hot and trapped indoors due to heat wave, smoke, and bad air quality, it's super enticing to jump into Skyrim and obsess over one of its coldest cities with lots of fresh snow and crisp winter air.

By the end of it, I got a lot done. However, there were tons more to do still. Yet my vacation was over and work was getting busy again, meaning I have a lot less free time.  Skyrim modding is not the only priority in my life, so sooner or later I'm going to need to put it on the back burner for a while. Looking at the rest of the work, I estimate that on my own it would take me a year or more to actually get to a content-complete state, and I can't guarantee to work on this for that long, so if left entirely to me, I might not get to the end at all.

There's also the problem that the remaining work involves designing interiors, creating NPCs, writing dialogue and quests, etcâ€¦ - all things that I'm not good at.

The obvious solution to the above, which people kept on telling me, is to ask for help from the community. I know we have many incredibly talented people in the community who could be interested in contributing to this project. In the past, we have many examples where great mods were made by people picking up and improving previous work. For example, [Complete Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36061/) led to [TRUE CITY - The Great Expansion of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60430/), which then led to [Solitude Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63685), and finally [Enhanced Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27816), which is currently our most epic Solitude expansion mod today.

Therefore, I am asking for folks to help. I am doing this in two ways. The first is really just the bare minimum of any "community effort" so it's really just stating the obvious. The second is what I will be focusing on from now.

1.	All my permissions are completely open. At the very basic level, anyone can "fork" my mod whenever and however they like. This way, even if my efforts at this project fails at the end, whatever's complete can be carried on by someone else down the road.

2.	I am soliciting interested folks to help out with interiors, NPCs, quests, clutter, etc... I have put a lot of effort in fleshing out the current state of the mod as a "base platform", such that contributors can build "addons" on top of it. The "base platform" handles all exterior layout, navmesh, and door links. The "base platform" will provide stub cells for interiors. For details, please see the [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md).

If you are interested to contribute, feel free to hit me up and we can have a chat. I maintain presence on NexusMods, reddit, and github. You are free to begin whenever and however. The [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md) should explain how I'm expecting contributions to play out. When you create addon mods, please follow [these guidelines](/windhelm/guidelines.md).

## Going Forward

I hope to have enough folks interested with creating interiors, NPCs, quests, clutter, etc... as addons. Again, please see [Community Effort Plan](/windhelm/plan.md). Meanwhile, I will gradually work on the base mod. If you want to see what's coming up in the base mod, [check out this page](windhelm/upcoming.md).

I expect my own progress on the base mod to be slow due to real life and other priorities. It is likely that I will only be able to work on this on the occasional weekends for the next while. Hopefully the community can help make some progress on the content front, and we'll have this in a playable state. In addition to working on the base mod, I will also be maintaining online presence, answering questions, and helping out resolving blocking issues addon authors may face to whatever degree I can.
