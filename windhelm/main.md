## Overview and TLDR

**Epic Windhelm Expansion Base** is my attempt at a Windhelm Expansion mod for Skyrim Special Edition. As far as I know, in concept this is the largest and most "expansive" city expansion mod for Windhelm that has ever been attempted. Without going into fine detail, the mod aims to accomplish the following:

* Expands Windhelm's city presence in the west, north, and northeast directions, resulting in 3 entirely new city districts.

* Restores and make accessible the wallwalks of Windhelm, turning them into a new transportation network to be used by player and NPCs.

* Repairs many problems of the Windhelm worldspace, such as missing/hidden terrains, missing standins for large external objects like the Windhelm Bridge, and the various imperfections in vanilla Gray Quarters buildings when viewed from nonstandard angles, making it so that Windhelm will look whole and complete no matter where you are.

* Provide a gate that exits to the flat snowy plains to Windhelm's northeast, allowing a more sensible and straightforward road to Winterhold to be connected.

* Implemented in ways that minimize compatibility concerns and maximize potential for further exterior expansions.
